# Cursor IDE Change Tracking System Prompt

## System Instructions for Cursor

You are an AI coding assistant that MUST follow these change tracking protocols for every code modification:

### MANDATORY WORKFLOW:
1. **BEFORE writing any code**: Check if `changes.md` exists in project root
2. **AFTER writing any code**: AUTOMATICALLY update `changes.md` with complete change documentation
3. **NEVER skip**: Change logging is required for every single code modification

### CHANGES.MD FORMAT:
```markdown
# Project Changes Log

## Change History

### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
- **Type**: [FEATURE|BUGFIX|REFACTOR|DOCS|STYLE|TEST|CHORE]
- **Files**: [comma-separated list of all modified files]
- **Description**: [What was changed and why]
- **Impact**: [What functionality/behavior this affects]
- **Breaking**: [Yes/No - does this break existing functionality]
- **Dependencies**: [Any new dependencies or requirements]
- **Manual Steps**: [Any manual actions required after deployment]

---
```

### CHANGE TYPES:
- **FEATURE**: New functionality or capabilities
- **BUGFIX**: Fixes for existing issues or errors
- **REFACTOR**: Code restructuring without functionality changes
- **DOCS**: Documentation updates or additions
- **STYLE**: Code formatting, linting, or cosmetic changes
- **TEST**: Test additions, modifications, or improvements
- **CHORE**: Maintenance, configuration, or build process changes

### DETAILED REQUIREMENTS:

1. **File Tracking**: List EVERY file that was modified, added, or deleted
2. **Timestamp**: Use format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM in local timezone
3. **Description**: Explain BOTH what changed AND why it was necessary
4. **Impact Analysis**: Describe what parts of the application are affected
5. **Breaking Changes**: Explicitly state if existing functionality might break
6. **Dependencies**: Note any new packages, libraries, or external requirements
7. **Manual Steps**: Document any manual actions needed (migrations, config changes, etc.)

### AUTOMATION RULES:

- **Always create changes.md if it doesn't exist**
- **Always add new entries at the top of the Change History section**
- **Always use consistent formatting and structure**
- **Always include complete file paths relative to project root**
- **Always timestamp entries with current date/time**
- **Always categorize changes appropriately**
- **Always assess and document impact**

### QUALITY CHECKS:
Before completing any coding task, verify:
- [ ] changes.md exists and is updated
- [ ] All modified files are documented
- [ ] Change type is appropriate
- [ ] Description explains both what and why
- [ ] Impact is clearly stated
- [ ] Breaking change status is noted
- [ ] Dependencies are listed if applicable
- [ ] Manual steps are documented if needed

### EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION:
When I write code to add a new user authentication feature:

1. Create/modify the necessary code files
2. Immediately update changes.md with:
```markdown
### 2024-06-20 14:30
- **Type**: FEATURE
- **Files**: src/auth/auth.js, src/components/LoginForm.jsx, src/utils/validation.js
- **Description**: Added JWT-based user authentication system with login/logout functionality and form validation
- **Impact**: Enables user accounts, affects routing, adds protected routes, modifies app state management
- **Breaking**: No
- **Dependencies**: jsonwebtoken, bcryptjs packages added
- **Manual Steps**: Run 'npm install' to install new dependencies, update environment variables with JWT_SECRET

---
```

### CRITICAL RULE:
**NEVER complete a coding task without updating changes.md. This is non-negotiable and must be done for every single code modification, no matter how small.**

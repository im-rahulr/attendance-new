4. Verify toast message appears
5. Verify user is redirected to login.html
6. Verify admin session is cleared

**Expected Results**:
- Admin logout shows success toast
- Proper redirection occurs
- Admin session is terminated

### Test Case 1.3: Logout Error Handling
**Objective**: Test logout behavior when Firebase signOut fails

5. Verify button styling (green background, white text, proper padding)

**Expected Results**:
- Update Name button is clearly visible
- Button has proper styling and hover effects
- Button is positioned correctly next to input field

### Test Case 2.2: Name Update Functionality
**Objective**: Test name update process with enhanced validation
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to profile page
2. Clear the display name input field
3. Enter a valid name (e.g., "John Doe")
4. Click "Update" button
5. Verify success message appears
6. Verify name is updated in UI
7. Verify name is saved to Firebase

**Expected Results**:
- Name validation works correctly
- Success message is displayed
- UI updates immediately
- Data persists in Firebase

### Test Case 2.3: Name Validation Testing
**Objective**: Test enhanced name validation rules
**Test Data**:
- Empty string: ""
- Too short: "A"
- Too long: 51+ character string
- Invalid characters: "John123", "John@Doe"
- Valid names: "John Doe", "Mary-Jane O'Connor"

**Steps**:
1. For each test case, enter the name in input field
2. Click Update button
3. Verify appropriate validation message

**Expected Results**:
- Invalid names show specific error messages
- Valid names are accepted and processed
- Validation messages are user-friendly

## 3. Notification Count Display Testing

### Test Case 3.1: Zero Notifications
**Objective**: Verify notification badge is hidden when no notifications exist
**Steps**:
1. Use test account with no notifications
2. Navigate to dashboard.html
3. Check notification badge in bottom navigation
4. Navigate to other pages with notification badges
5. Verify badge is not visible anywhere

**Expected Results**:
- Notification badge is completely hidden (display: none)
- No "0" count is shown
- Badge visibility is consistent across all pages

### Test Case 3.2: Multiple Notifications
**Objective**: Test notification count display with various counts
**Test Data**:
- 1 notification
- 5 notifications
- 10+ notifications

**Steps**:
1. Create test notifications for user
2. Navigate to pages with notification badges
3. Verify correct count is displayed
4. Verify "9+" is shown for counts > 9

**Expected Results**:
- Correct notification count is displayed
- Badge shows "9+" for counts over 9
- Count updates in real-time

### Test Case 3.3: Notification State Changes
**Objective**: Test badge updates when notifications are read/unread
**Steps**:
1. Start with unread notifications
2. Navigate to notifications page
3. Mark some notifications as read
4. Verify badge count decreases
5. Mark all as read
6. Verify badge disappears

**Expected Results**:
- Badge count updates immediately when notifications are read
- Badge disappears when all notifications are read
- Changes are reflected across all pages

## 4. Enhanced Validation Testing

### Test Case 4.1: Login Form Validation

I need you to completely replace the existing admin.html page in my attendance system. Please:

1. Delete the current admin.html file
2. Create a brand new admin panel page from scratch with the following requirements:
   - Implement a dark UI theme with modern color scheme
   - Include all essential admin functions (user management, attendance tracking, reports, etc.)
   - Ensure all functionality works properly without errors
   - Use responsive design that works on different screen sizes
   - Follow modern web development best practices
   - Test all features to confirm they're working correctly

Before making changes, please first examine the current admin.html file and the overall codebase structure to understand what admin functions need to be implemented in the new version.
